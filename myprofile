India is my country
All indians are my brothers and sisters
I love my country
And i m proud of its rich and varied heritage
i shall always strive to be worthy of it
I shall give my parents, teachers and all elders respect and treat everyone with courtesy.
TO my country and my people i pledge my devotion..in their well being and prosperity along with my happiness.
Jai hind
